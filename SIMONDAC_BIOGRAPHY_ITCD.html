    <h2 style="color:#702632">Teenage Years</h2>


    <p title="TEENAGE YEARS"><dd>
        My teenage years have been nothing short of a roller coaster ride.<sup>1</sup> From the day I turned 13 all the way to 19, my teenage years have been full of phases as well as trials and errors.<sup>2</sup> 
        Like most teenagers, I have leaned a lot throughout my time being a teenager and now it's time to say goodbye.<sup>3</sup>When I look back at my teenage years the first thing that comes to mind is conformity. <sup>4</sup>
        Being a teenage boy meant trying to be like all of the other teenage boy your age, at least that's how it was for me. <sup>5</sup> I remember in elementary days when I was about 13 or 14, shopping at specific stores that all of my friends were shopping at so I could have similar clothing. 
        <sup>6</sup>How boring is that? Always trying to be like everyone else got old fairly quickly for me. By the time I got to high school I finally started to embrace more of my own style and not just conform to everyone else's clothing.<sup>7</sup>
        During the beginning of my teenage years, I was really focused on being liked and accepted by people and would go along with whatever my friends were doing. <sup>8</sup>However, as I got older I started to be more confident in myself and wanted 
        to start doing things that made me genuinely happy and wanted to find people with similar interests. <sup>9</sup>This took a while. I went through many friendships to find my true friends that I still have today. <sup>10</sup>I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it can take a awhile for a 
        person to truly grow into themselves and in turn find people like them, so it's okay. <sup>11</sup> My time being a teenager was definitely a journey. <sup>12</sup> I went through many experiences, both positive and negative to get to where I am today. <sup>13</sup> 
        I really did have to take my experiences and do my best to grow from them.<sup>14</sup> With that all being said, I really am grateful for everything I went through as a teenager. <sup>15</sup>From coming home and crying to my mom, to hanging out with friends after school and on the weekends, 
        to dealing with petty high school drama, I am thankful for it all. <sup>16</sup> I know without those experiences and many others, I would not be the person I am today. <sup>17</sup> Being a teenager is hard and confusing.<sup>18</sup> So many aspects of your life change as you grow into an adult.<sup>19</sup> 
        But I survived and lived to tell the tale. <sup>20</sup>

    <p title="COLLEGE EXPERIENCE">
        
        <blockquote>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My college experience is my initial step into finding my future career.<sup>1</sup> Leaving home for the first time in my life and finding out if I have the skills to make it in the real world. <sup>2</sup>
        However due to <i>COVID-19</i> I wasn't able to go school and experience <i>The best years of your life</i> <sup>3</sup>. This is my first time taking online class. <sup>4</sup> Actually, we are the first batch who are affected of this pandemic <sup>5</sup>
        Online learning is something new. <sup>6</sup> Taking online courses over the traditional face-to-face courses is not an easy route. <sup>7</sup> Online courses offer students the flexibility to learn in their own space and time, but that does not change the amount of work they have to put it in.
        <sup>8</sup> Being said that, I had a great experience with online courses. <sup>9</sup> Online classes offered me the flexibility to balance school, work, and family. <sup>10</sup> As a second year student, taking Information Technology, this is my dream program. <sup>11</sup> 
        Also, being part of the student council is somehow hard but enjoyable. <sup>12</sup> Hard because as a clingy person who wants to mingle with others, it hard for me to express myself thru online platforms. <sup>13</sup> 
        Online classes require discipline and time management as any face-to-face class does. <sup>14</sup> Like traditional classes, online classes have deadlines for assignments, and it is very important to keep up with the deadlines to do well in the online courses. <sup>15</sup>
        I can say my college years is also memorable since we need to accept that this is the new normal, the online set up. <sup>16</sup> College life teaches me to be independent. <sup>17</sup> Especially to this kind of mode of learning. <sup>18</sup>
        This year, although I do not constantly interact with the teachers, I am learning my own ways to study. <sup>19</sup> All in all, my college years are amazing yet eye opener. <sup>20</sup>
